## Day 12: March 12, Thuesday

**Today's Progress:**
* Added Details to the readme file
* Created this Log file and filled the last days with my Twitter Tweets

## Day 10: March 10, Thuesday

**Thoughts:** Today was a "mÃ¤h"-Day. I didn't do much. Some SEO details, some docu reading and a little planning, as I don't know how to go on at the moment. Do I really need a full Author Template?

Call it a-Day now.

## Day 7: March 07, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** >.<

**Thoughts:** Best day ever... NOT!

**Thoughts:** I HATE MYSELF RIGHT NOW!

Lost over 1.5h over searching for a solution for my not working highlighting of the current menu item.
The solution: Don't include the partial with {{partialCached "footer.html"}}

**Thoughts:** Web development is my full time job. But after work isn't much space for private projects. Thus, I almost everytime discarded my projects.
Now I want to stick on to one project - a custom theme for my private blog.
